    * The html file was created within prExample branch. 
    * Edited the html file.
    * Satisfied with the html file so it is now time to push the file from branch to main.

* Pushed the html file from branch prExample to main.

* Now I will try to delete the branch.
    * I have successfully managed to delete the branch prExample.
